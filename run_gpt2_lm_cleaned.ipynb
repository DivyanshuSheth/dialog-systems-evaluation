Your task is to rate the response on several metrics. The response for one metric should not influence other metrics. For example, if a response is not understandable or has grammatical errors - you should try to ignore this when considering whether it maintains context or if it is interesting.\n",
        "The following are the metrics and corresponding rating scales that each response is required to be rated on:\n",
        "Understandable (0 - 1): Is the response understandable in the context of the history? A score of 0 (no) means that the response is difficult to understand. You do not know what the person is trying to say. A score of 1 (yes) means that the response is understandable. You know what the person is trying to say.\n",
        "Natural (1 - 3): Is the response naturally written? A score of 1 (bad) means that the response is unnatural. A score of 2 (ok) means the response is strange, but not entirely unnatural. A response of 3 (good) means that the response is natural.\n",
        "Maintains Context (1 - 3): Does the response serve as a valid continuation of the conversation history? A score of 1 (no) means that the response drastically changes topic or ignores the conversation history. A score of 2 (somewhat) means the response refers to the conversation history in a limited capacity (e.g.,in a generic way) and shifts the conversation topic. A score of 3 (yes) means the response is on topic and strongly acknowledges the conversation history.\n",
        "Interesting (1 - 3): Is the response dull or interesting? A score of 1 (dull) means that the response is generic and dull. A score of 2 (somewhat interesting) means the response is somewhat interesting and could engage you in the conversation (e.g., an opinion, thought). A score of 3 (interesting) means the response is very interesting or presents an interesting fact.\n",
        "Uses Knowledge (0 - 1): Given the fact that the response is conditioned on, how well does the response use that fact? A score of 0 (no) means the response does not mention or refer to the fact at all. Ascore of 1 (yes) means the response uses the fact well.\n",
        "Overall Quality (1 - 5): Given your answers above, what is your overall impression of the generated response/utterance? A score of 1 (very bad) means the response is completely invalid, and it would be difficult to recover the conversation after this. A score of 2 (bad) means that the response is valid, but otherwise poor in quality. A score of 3 (neutral) means the response is neither good nor bad, and has no negative qualities, but no positive ones either. A score of 4 (good) means this is a good response, but falls short of being perfect because of a key flaw. A score of 5 (very good) means this response is good and does not have any strong flaws.\"\"\""

A score of 3 (yes) means the response is on topic and strongly acknowledges the conversation history.\n",

A score of 2 (somewhat interesting) means the response is somewhat interesting and could engage you in the conversation (e.g., an opinion, thought). A score of 3 (interesting) means the response is very interesting or presents an interesting fact.\n",

A score of 4 (good) means this is a good response, but falls short of being perfect because of a key flaw. A score of 5 (very good) means this response is good and does not have any strong flaws.\n",

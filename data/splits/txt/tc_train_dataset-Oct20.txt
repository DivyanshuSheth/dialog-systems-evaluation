Person 2:  women can be tough too. would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl? 
Person 1:  this is going to come off sounding bad, but it isn't meant to. i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views. the sponsors would love the coverage. 
Person 2:  belichick has done well in the post season, so i think he's looking at it from a strategic point of view. the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products. 

Facts:
the cleveland browns'last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick. this was bill's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots.

Generated response: 
Person 1: i think belichick is very strategic and he wouldn't do something if it wouldn't help his team win. the last time cleveland won a game in the playoffs was when belichick was their coach. shows how lucky teams are to have him.

Context:
Person 1:  though not one of the top three richest presidents, maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office. the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office. maybe trump can get four albums out. he might need to get re - elected though. 
Person 2:  i don't know, i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead. 
Person 1:  what nickname has trump earned?? until 1805, the runner - up in a presidential election became vp. i think this system should be reinstated. the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion. there's not much getting done in government anyway. seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh's

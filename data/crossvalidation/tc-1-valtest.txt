Person 1:  football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams. khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks. they definitely felt his absence. i don't know why they didn't just resign him. 
Person 2:  maybe he demanded a high salary? what is your favorite nfl team? 

Generated response: 
Person 1: i like the giants best, you?. he did demand a high salary. he's the highest paid defensive player in the nfl. i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden.

Person 1: i like the giants best, you?. he did demand a high salary. he's the highest paid defensive player in the nfl. i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden.

Person 1:  i feel like... there are enough talented women athletes out there, that a woman kicker or qb is possible, perhaps a wide receiver. 
Person 2:  women can be tough too. would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl? 
Person 1:  this is going to come off sounding bad, but it isn't meant to. i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views. the sponsors would love the coverage. 
Person 2:  belichick has done well in the post season, so i think he's looking at it from a strategic point of view. the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products. 

Facts:
the cleveland browns'last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick. this was bill's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots.

Generated response: 
Person 1: i think belichick is very strategic and he wouldn't do something if it wouldn't help his team win. the last time cleveland won a game in the playoffs was when belichick was their coach. shows how lucky teams are to have him.

Person 1:  do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her? 
Person 2:  i do not watch her, so i can not judge. it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns. so, if they feel she's worth it, then it's not my place to judge. but that type of draw opens up other markets. for example, carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street. 
Person 1:  it was the 70s, she was the star at that time, it makes sense. i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase. 
Person 2:  it is definitely here to stay if not expanding. in the early days, you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video. today, most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos. some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras.

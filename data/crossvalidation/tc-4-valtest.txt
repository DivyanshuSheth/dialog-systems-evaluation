Person 1:  wonder why the did it without an audience? pretty sure people would have shown if they're heard about it. must be one of those " eccentric rock and roll musician " things. wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater... 
Person 2:  it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater. there's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that's used for concerts. those romans really liked their theaters 
Person 1:  well, theaters were a big event at the time, plays, gladiator events, concerts.. you got ta remember, they didn't have the internet back then, so they had to do something for entertainment. :) so, what was the last concert you ever attended? 
Person 2:  now that i think about it, i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime, so most of the songs were christmas songs. the venue was fairly big, but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform. it was good still, unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

Generated response: 
Person 1: oh, man, can't imagine a concert being so bad you get sued by the audience members... guessing maybe they had mechanical problems, or one of the band members wasn't performing very well. i recall news of a concert ( not creed, can't recall who it was ) where the guy was drunk on stage, and slurred through his songs. they ended up refunding the audience's money..

Person 1:  wonder why the did it without an audience? pretty sure people would have shown if they're heard about it. must be one of those " eccentric rock and roll musician " things. wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater... 
Person 2:  it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater. there's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that's used for concerts. those romans really liked their theaters 
Person 1:  well, theaters were a big event at the time, plays, gladiator events, concerts.. you got ta remember, they didn't have the internet back then, so they had to do something for entertainment. :) so, what was the last concert you ever attended? 
Person 2:  now that i think about it, i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime, so most of the songs were christmas songs. the venue was fairly big, but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform. it was good still, unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

Facts:
in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band

Generated response: 
Person 1: yeah i heard about that! i wonder how bad that concert must have been.

[ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .\n",

A score of 1 (no) means that the response drastically changes topic or ignores the conversation history.

A score of 3 (yes) means the response is on topic and strongly acknowledges the conversation history.\n",
        "Interesting (1 - 3): Is the response dull or interesting? A score of 1 (dull) means that the response is generic and dull. A score of 2 (somewhat interesting) means the response is somewhat interesting and could engage you in the conversation (e.g., an opinion, thought). A score of 3 (interesting) means the response is very interesting or presents an interesting fact.\n",
        "Uses Knowledge (0 - 1): Given the fact that the response is conditioned on, how well does the response use that fact? A score of 0 (no) means the response does not mention or refer to the fact at all. Ascore of 1 (yes) means the response uses the fact well.\n",
        "Overall Quality (1 - 5): Given your answers above, what is your overall impression of the generated response/utterance?

For example, if a response is not understandable or has grammatical errors - you should try to ignore this when considering whether it maintains context or if it is interesting.\n",

        "Understandable (0 - 1): Is the response understandable in the context of the history? A score of 0 (no) means that the response is difficult to understand. You do not know what the person is trying to say. A score of 1 (yes) means that the response is understandable. You know what the person is trying to say.\n",
        "Natural (1 - 3): Is the response naturally written? A score of 1 (bad) means that the response is unnatural. A score of 2 (ok) means the response is strange, but not entirely unnatural. A response of 3 (good) means that the response is natural.\n",
        "Maintains Context (1 - 3): Does the response serve as a valid continuation of the conversation history? A score of 1 (no) means that the response drastically changes topic or ignores the conversation history. A score of 2 (somewhat) means the response refers to the conversation history in a limited capacity (e.g.,in a generic way) and shifts the conversation topic. A score of 3 (yes) means the response is on topic and strongly acknowledges the conversation history.\n",
        "Interesting (1 - 3): Is the response dull or interesting? A score of 1 (dull) means that the response is generic and dull. A score of 2 (somewhat interesting) means the response is somewhat interesting and could engage you in the conversation (e.g., an opinion, thought). A score of 3 (interesting) means the response is very interesting or presents an interesting fact.\n",
        "Uses Knowledge (0 - 1): Given the fact that the response is conditioned on, how well does the response use that fact? A score of 0 (no) means the response does not mention or refer to the fact at all. Ascore of 1 (yes) means the response uses the fact well.\n",
        "Overall Quality (1 - 5): Given your answers above, what is your overall impression of the generated response/utterance? A score of 1 (very bad) means the response is completely invalid, and it would be difficult to recover the conversation after this. A score of 2 (bad) means that the response is valid, but otherwise poor in quality. A score of 3 (neutral) means the response is neither good nor bad, and has no negative qualities, but no positive ones either. A score of 4 (good) means this is a good response, but falls short of being perfect because of a key flaw. A score of 5 (very good) means this response is good and does not have any strong flaws.\n",
